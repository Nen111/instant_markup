# instant_markup
Beginning Python From Novice To Professional - Chapter 20 - Projects 1

Run in cmd:
type .\test_input.txt | python .\markup.py > .\test_output.html


Several expansions are possible for this program. Here are some possibilities:
• Add support for tables. Find all aligning left word borders and split the block into columns.
• Add support for interpreting all uppercase words as emphasis. (To do this properly, you will need to take into account acronyms, punctuations, names, and other capitalized words.)
• Add support for LATEX output.
• Write a handler that does something other than markup. Perhaps write a handler that analyzes the document in some way.
• Create a script that automatically converts all text files in a directory to HTML files.
• Check out some existing plain-text formats, such as Markdown, reStructuredText, or the format used in Wikipedia.
